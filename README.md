Second coursework related to event extraction in biomedical texts

Had to build the first stage of a biomedical event extractor. Biomedical events are state changes of biomolecules. For example, if you have a protein and you add a phosphate (PO4) group to it, this is referred to as a phosphorylation event. Many papers in the biomedical literature mention such events. The grand goal of biomedical event extraction is to teach machines how to read this literature and produce structured representations of biomedical events that biomedical researchers can query effectively. This task has received considerable attention in the NLP literature, and is the topic of a biennial shared task.
